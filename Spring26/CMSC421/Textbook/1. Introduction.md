- The field of AI "is concerned with not just understanding but also *building* intelligent entities - machines that can compute how to act effectively and safely in a wide variety of novel situations".
## 1.1 What Is AI?
- "Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not".
- Research in two dimensions: human vs rational and thought vs behavior.
### 1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
- To pass the Turing test (Alan Turing 1950), a computer had to have:
	- NLP to communicate successfully in a human language.
	- Knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears.
	- Automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
	- Machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
- Other researchers proposed a **total Turing test**. Adding on two more requirements:
	- Computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world.
	- Robotics to manipulate objects and move about.
### 1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
- Three ways to learn about human thought:
	- Introspection: trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by.
	- Psychological experiments: observing a person in action.
	- Brain imaging: observing the brain in action.
- After sufficient data, we can attempt to express our theories of the brain as a computer program.
- Neurological research and AI develop separately but in parallel, these two fields can shed further light in each other.
### 1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The "laws of thought" approach
