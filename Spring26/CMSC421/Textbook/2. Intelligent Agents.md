- Rational agents are central to our approach to AI.
- Chapter 2 will refine and dive into the concepts of rational agents.
- Exploring the agents, environments, and the coupling between these two.
	- How agents behave depending on the environment.
	- How the types of environments influence agents differently.
- Introduce basic archetypes of agent designs.
## 2.1 Agents and Environments
>An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. 
- A human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors and hands, legs, vocal tract, and so on for actuators.
- A robotic agent may have cameras and infrared range finders for sensors and various motors for actuators.
- A software agent receives file contents, network packets, and human input as sensory inputs and acts on the environment by writing files, sending network packets, and displaying information or generating sounds.
	- The environment could be anything and everything!

- Percept: refers to the content an agent's sensors are perceiving.
	- Percept sequence: the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
- An agent's behavior is described by the *agent function* that maps any given percept sequence to an action.
