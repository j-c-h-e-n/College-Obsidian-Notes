# More Datatypes
## Creating Datatypes Using `type` Keyword
We can create and denote out own datatypes using the type keyword.
```ocaml
type color = Blue|Red|Green
: type color = Blue | Red | Green

let is_blue x = match x with
| Blue -> true
| _ -> false
: color -> bool = <fun>
```
The datatypes we created **must start with a capital letter**.<br>
Custom types in OCaml is akin to Enums in other languages.
### "of" Keyword
If we wanted to store information within our custom datatypes we use the `of` keyword.
```ocaml
type llist = Nil|Elem of int;;
: llist = Nul | Elem of int

Nil;;
: llist = Nil

Elem;;
: The constructor Elem expects 1 arguments(s), but is applied here to 0 argument(s)

Elem(3);;
: llist = Elem 3
```
We can extract values from our information-holding datatype by matching it with `Elem(x)` 
```ocaml
let get_elem x -> match x with 
| Elem(y) -> y
```
We can create several different `Elem`s of the `llist` type by doing `let e1 = Elem 7`.<br>
#### Recursively Defining Structures
Taking the concepts previously even further, we can let Elem be a tuple, and nest `llist` within itself. 
```ocaml
type llist = Nil|Elem of (int * list);;
: llist = Nil | Elem of (int * list)

Elem(8, Nil);;
: llist = Elem (8, Nil)

Elem(1,Elem(2,Elem(3,Nil))));;
: llist = Elem (1, Elem (2, Elem (3, Nil)))

```
With this idea, we can then use recursion to access each sub-element within `Elem` within the `llist` type:
```ocaml
let rec llist_len llst = match llst with
| Nil -> 0
| Elem(value, rest) -> 1 + (llist_len rest);;
: llist_len : llist -> int = <fun>
```

# Applications
## "Heterogenous" List
Since lists can only store homogenous types within it, it raises an issue when we require a list-type that accepts heterogenous types.<br>
Using ints and floats as examples, we can use the `type` keyword to create a type called `number`, and then we can wrap ints and floats inside the number type, creating a list of the wrapper number.
```ocaml
type number = Int of int|Float of float;;
: Int of int | Float of float

let rec add_nums lst = match lst with
| [] -> (0, 0.0)
| Int(x)::xs -> let int_sum,float_sum = (add_nums xs) in 
				(x + int_sum, float_sum)
| Float(y)::ys -> let int_sum,float_sum = (add_nums ys) in
				(int_sum, y +. float_sum);;
: number list -> int * float = <fun>

let lst = [Int(1);Float(2.1);Int(3);Float(4.2)];;
add_nums lst;;
: int * float = (4, 6.3000000000000071)
```
The `add_nums` function matches the list of `numbers` with `Int(x)::xs` and `Float(y)::ys` so we can extract the data from the list. Then we take the extracted information and pass them through an anonymous function that wants an `int_sum` and `float_sum`, calls `add_nums xs` onto the remaining list, and then when recursion ends, starts to sum up the `x` and `y` in their respective spots in the returning tuple.

### Performing with Fold Instead
Using Fold, we can significantly simplify this function.
```ocaml
let num_add lst = fold (fun acc valu -> 
				let i, f = acc in 
				match valu with 
				| Int(x) -> (x+i, f)
				| Float(y) -> (i, y+.f)) (0,0.0) lst;;
```
We pass a function into fold that takes in an accumulator `acc` and the current value `valu`, pass into another function that wants an int `i` and float `f` from the accumulator `acc`, then matches `valu` with `Int(x)` and `Float(y)`, summing them with the `i` and `f` from `acc`.

## Trees
Using these concepts, we can create Trees in OCaml:
```ocaml
type tree = Node of (tree * int * tree)|Leaf;;
| tree = (tree * int * tree) | Leaf

Node(Leaf,6,(Node(Leaf,5,Leaf)));;
: tree = Node (Leaf, 6, Node (Leaf, 5, Leaf))
```
We have a tuple that stores 3 items of information because it stores a left node, the value of the current node, and then a right node.<br>
We can extract information by:
```ocaml
match tree with
| Node(l,v,r) when v = 6 -> v
| Leaf -> 0
| _ -> -1;;
```
The first case returns 6 if a node has a value of 6, else if it is a Leaf return 0, else return -1.

# Records
OCaml's functional side is all about immutability and minimizing side-effects. But due to the limited nature of functional, OCaml supports some imperative programming and the `records` type is one such way of enabling OCaml to step outside its functional limits.<br>
Records have attributes that can manipulated.
```ocaml
type user = {name:string; age:int; height:float};;
: user = { name : string; age : int; height : float; }

let user1 = {name="bob"; age:28; height: 5.5};;

u1.name;;
: string = "bob"

u1.age;;
: int = 28
```
Notice how the record `user` is structured and accessed very similarly to dictionaries or objects in Python or Java.<br>
Accessing elements within a function involve more pattern matching:
```ocaml
let get_name r = match r with
| {name=n} -> n;;
```
Normally this function would fail as there is an unbound record field "name", which is why a record has to be defined first with the specified fields before the function can be valid.
