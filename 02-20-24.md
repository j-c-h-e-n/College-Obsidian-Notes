# Regular Expressions
"Regex" comes from a theory very closely related to **finite automata**.
## Expression Creation
Regex can be thought as a tool used to search and extract text. This means that there are patterns that we must consider:
- Alphabets - the set of symbols/characters allowed.
- Concatenation - the recognition of strings and combinations of alphabet defined characters.
- Alternation - being able to say that one thing is a part of another. i.e. a string in a set S is in either S<sub>1</sub> or S<sub>2</sub>.
- Quantification - recognizing and allowing repeating patterns.
- Precedence.<br>
Most languages use the POSIX-EXT standard, but different languages may have different support. <br>
A regular expression can be as simple as `a` or `James`. But something more complicated could be a set of greetings such as: `hello|hi|good morning|sup|salutations`.<br>
The pipe bar (|) is called the "or" operation, which can be used in ways such as describing the set of digits: `0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9`. <br>
What if we wanted to describe a set of strings like "I am x years old", $0 \leq{x} \leq{9}$?
A brute force method would be `I am 0 years old|I am 1 years old|...` but using regex we can denote `I am (0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9) years old` to shorthand it. Note the wrapping parenthesis.<br>
We can use multiple parenthesis with multiple different "or groupings" to create a set of all variations: `(hi|bye) cl(i|y)ff` results in the set: {"hi cliff", "bye cliff", "hi clyff", "bye clyff"}.<br>
### Operators
- The *Kleene* operator (\*) repeats patterns:
	- `(ha)*` -> {"", "ha", "haha", "hahaha", ...}
- (+) one or more repetitions:
	- `(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)+` -> the set created from `(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)`
- (?) repeat one or zero times.
- ({x}) repeat x times.
- ({x,}) repeat at least x times.
- ({,y}) repeat at most y times.
- ({x,y}) repeat between x and y times (inclusive).<br>
Listing out a sequence of numbers and other similar sequences becomes unwieldy, there are bracket expressions that let us denote anything that is a range:
- `[a-z]{3}` -> any ASCII between a-z (inclusive) repeated 3 times.
- `[0-9]+` -> any ASCII between 0-9 (inclusive) repeated at least once.
- `[aeiou]` -> any vowel, same as `(a|e|i|o|u)`.
- `[a-zA-Z]` -> any upper or lowercase letter, same as `[a-z]|[A-Z]`.
- `[^abc]` -> anything EXCEPT "a", "b", or "c".<br>
Brackets help describe ranges, meanwhile the dot character (.) represents ANY character:
- `.{3}` -> any string of length 3.
- `.at` -> any string of length 3 that ends with 'at'.

# Expression Matching
If a string, *s*, is described by the regex *r*, then we say that *r* **accepts** *s*. If *s* is not in the set, then *r* **rejects** *s*. Checking if a regex accepts or rejects a string is done in O(n).<br>
There's also exact matching and partial matching where:
- Exact matching:
	- match("unknowing", "know") returns false since "unknowing" is not in "know".
- Partial matching:
	- match("unknowing", "know") returns true since "know" can be found in "knowing".<br>
If a language's default is partial matching, we have two symbols that helps us achieve something similar to an exact match:
- `^` -> `^ch` -> any string that begins with 'ch'.
- `$` -> `at$` -> any string that ends with 'at'.
This can be used so that:
- `^(this|that)` -> any string that begins with 'this or that'.
- `^this|that` -> any string that beings with 'this' or contains 'that'.
- `(this|that)$` -> any string that ends with 'this or that'.
- `this|that$` -> any string that ends with 'that' or contains 'this'.<br>
If we use both of the symbols, we can obtain exact match functionality:
- `^(this|that)$` -> exact match with the string "this" or the string "that".<br>
# Regex Grouping
Beyond checking for acceptance of a string, regex is more useful to extract data from a string. <br>
If we were to extract area codes from a phone book:
- Partial match:
	- `([0-9]{3})-[0-9]{7}` -> this extracts a 3 digit number, a dash, and then a 7 digit number.
- Exact match:
	- `[A-Z}[a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+:([0-9{3})-[0-9]{7}` -> this makes assumptions about what a valid name is. <br>
If we wanted a more exact match with a particular person, we could use the following: <br>
`James's phone number is (([0-9]{3})-([0-9]{7}))`-> this will find an exact matching with the character portion, and then extract a phone number with the number matching.
