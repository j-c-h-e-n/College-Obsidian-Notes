# Grammars
## Compilers and Interpreters
- Compiler: converts language to machine code
- Abstracted: convert from language to another.<br>
3 things we need for a translator:
- Lexer
- Parser
- Evaluator/Generator
These 3 thing are unique to each and every language as they evaluate for the language they are associated with. For example, normal English words would not pass a translator for math.
### Lexer
A lexer for a translator will ONLY check if the checked word is an actual word in the language.
- Examples that would pass the lexer in the English language:
	- "toyboat", "yes", "hi", "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
- Examples that would not pass:
	- "aaaa", "17sa7d8fh3", "+++++-s"
A lexer typically uses Regex to convert text file to a list of tokens (word types). <br>
### Parser
A parser is basically a grammar checker.
- Examples that would pass the parser in the English language:
	- "The chair fell over", "fell over the chair".
- Examples that would not pass:
	- "fell chair over", "fell over the chair"
A parser converts tokens to an abstract syntax tree using a context free grammar (CFG).<br>
### Evaluator/Generator
An evaluator applies logic to the phrase being analyzed. For a simpler example, let's use math:
- Examples that would pass the evaluator in math:
	-  `1 + 2 = 3`, `25 * 4 = 100`
- Examples that would fail:
	- `1 + 1 = 23`, `98 * 1 = 5219`

## Context Free Grammars (CFG)
An example, if $x$, then $x$ is in the alphabet ($\Sigma$). If $x$ and $y$ are in the set, then $xy$.
$$\begin{cases} 
	x \rightarrow x \in \Sigma \\
	x, y \in S \rightarrow xy \\
\end{cases}$$
Taking this further, we can represent a string $S$ :
$$\begin{aligned}
&S \rightarrow AB \\
&A \rightarrow aA \\
&A \rightarrow b \\
&B \rightarrow cd
\end{aligned}$$
This means that $S$ is a creates a string $AB$, $A$ creates $aA$ or $b$, and $B$ creates $cd$.<br>
Consider the simple regex grammar for /\[01\]+/:
$$S \rightarrow 0S|1S|1|0$$
If we wanted to generate the string "001":
$$\begin{align}
& S \rightarrow 0S\\
& 0S \rightarrow 00S\\
& 00S \rightarrow 001S\\
& 001S \rightarrow 001
\end{align}$$
Here it is seen that we are building up the string one step at a time. This is called deriving<br>
## Building a Language
A more complicated math example can have us build a language with a small subset of what math offers.
$$\begin{align}
E \rightarrow& E + E\\
&|E - E\\
&|E * E\\
&|(E)\\
&|0|1|2\\
\end{align}$$
We have created a language where we've recursively defined what $E$ could be. $E$ can be a relation of $E + E$, and each $E$ inside can be any of the $E$ definitions. Note, a recursive definition must have a base case or else it will forever recurse. Our base case is called the "terminal definition" and $E \rightarrow 0|1|2$ is the terminal definition.<br>
Some valid strings that can be built from this language include:
- $2 + 1$
- $2 + 1 - (0 + 1)$
- $2 * 1 - (2 - 1) * 0$
We can trace the building of these strings using the deriving process shown above with the string "001".
<br>
Example:
$$\begin{align}
E \rightarrow &E + E\\
&| E - E\\
&| E * E\\
&| n, n \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align}$$
With this definition, it accepts strings such as $1+2+3$ as the numbers are all defined in the set of integers.
### Order of Operations
A question arises, especially with math languages: How do we create an order of operations? Some derivations will be left-reading, and others will be right-reading, so an equation such as $3+4*2$ would evaluate to $16$ if left-evaluated, but equal to $11$ if right-evaluated. This is important as when we evaluate a sentence, it will come out as a tree structure and we evaluate it from the bottom-up. Thus if something is left-evaluated, it will read from the bottom right of the tree and vice-versa, creating our order of operations dilemma.
