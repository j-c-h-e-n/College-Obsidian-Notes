Below is a detailed, component-by-component summary with practical usage examples for building agent workflows using the OpenAI Agents SDK.

---

## 1. Agents  
**Summary:**  
- **Definition:** An agent is an LLM (or a model) configured with a set of instructions (system prompt) and a suite of tools. It’s the primary building block that “thinks” and “acts” in your application.  
- **Configuration:** You define agents with properties like `name`, `instructions`, and optionally a specific `model` and `tools`. They can also have an associated output type (using Pydantic models or dataclasses) for structured responses.  
- **Workflow:** An agent can run a complete loop – receive input, call tools, optionally delegate to sub-agents (handoffs), and produce a final output.  
- **Context:** Agents are generic over context types, allowing you to inject local data (e.g., user info, dependencies) into tool calls and lifecycle hooks.

**Practical Example:**  
A simple “haiku generator” agent:  
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(
    name="Haiku Agent",
    instructions="Always respond in haiku form."
)

result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(result.final_output)
```

---

## 2. Models  
**Summary:**  
- **Role:** Models provide the core intelligence and reasoning behind an agent. They process instructions and generate outputs.  
- **Varieties:** OpenAI’s offerings include models like **o1**, **o3-mini**, **GPT-4.5**, **GPT-4o**, and **GPT-4o-mini**. Each is optimized for different tasks such as planning, execution, or low-latency responses.  
- **Flexibility:** You can mix models within a workflow. For instance, using a faster model for triage and a more powerful one for detailed processing.  
- **Interoperability:** The SDK allows integration of non–OpenAI models if they adhere to a Chat Completions-style API.

**Practical Example:**  
Using different models for different agents in a triage scenario:  
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel, AsyncOpenAI
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish Agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
    model="o3-mini",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English Agent",
    instructions="You only speak English.",
    model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model="gpt-4o",
        openai_client=AsyncOpenAI()
    ),
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Determine language and handoff accordingly.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## 3. Tools  
**Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Tools extend an agent’s capabilities to interact with the external world. They might fetch data, call functions, or even control a computer.  
- **Types:**
  - **Hosted Tools:** Provided by OpenAI (e.g., web search, file search, computer use).  
  - **Function Tools:** Wrap any Python function to expose it as a callable tool; the SDK automatically infers parameter types and docstrings.  
  - **Agents as Tools:** Use a fully defined agent as a tool within another agent’s workflow.
- **Customization:** You can force the usage of a specific tool or allow the LLM to choose automatically.

**Practical Example (Function Tool):**  
```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Agent",
    instructions="Provide weather updates.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)
```

**Practical Example (Hosted Tool):**  
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, WebSearchTool, FileSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    name="Travel Assistant",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(max_num_results=3, vector_store_ids=["VECTOR_STORE_ID"]),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Which coffee shop should I visit in SF today?")
    print(result.final_output)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## 4. Knowledge and Memory  
**Summary:**  
- **Function:** Augments agents with persistent data beyond their training.  
- **Components:**  
  - **Vector Stores:** Allow semantic search across documents to retrieve relevant information at runtime.  
  - **Embeddings:** Represent data in a way that makes fast retrieval and integration into agent responses possible.
- **Usage:** Useful for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and long-term memory in agent applications.

**Practical Usage:**  
Integrate your document data as a vector store and let the agent query it for context during conversation.

---

## 5. Guardrails  
**Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Ensure agent outputs and behaviors remain safe and within predefined boundaries.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Input Guardrails:** Validate and screen user input before the agent processes it.  
  - **Output Guardrails:** Validate the final output from the agent before it is delivered.  
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Guardrails run parallel checks using specialized agents or functions.  
  - They can trigger “tripwires” that immediately halt execution if unsafe or irrelevant content is detected.

**Practical Example (Input Guardrail):**  
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import Agent, Runner, GuardrailFunctionOutput, input_guardrail, InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered

class MathCheck(BaseModel):
    is_math_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Guardrail",
    instructions="Determine if the input is math homework.",
    output_type=MathCheck,
)

@input_guardrail
async def math_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=result.final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=result.final_output.is_math_homework,
    )

agent = Agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    instructions="Help customers with their queries.",
    input_guardrails=[math_guardrail],
)

async def main():
    try:
        await Runner.run(agent, "Help me solve for x in 2x + 3 = 11")
    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
        print("Guardrail tripped: math homework detected.")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## 6. Orchestration  
**Summary:**  
- **Definition:** Orchestration is the process of managing multiple agents’ interactions, sequencing their execution, and handling their outputs.  
- **Methods:**  
  - **LLM-Driven Orchestration:** The LLM itself decides which tools or agents to call next based on its reasoning.  
  - **Code-Driven Orchestration:** You explicitly chain agent calls, process outputs, and determine next steps in your code.
- **Handoffs:**  
  - **Purpose:** Enable one agent to delegate part of a task to a specialized sub-agent.
  - **Customization:** You can define handoff rules, input filters, and even callbacks (e.g., for logging or pre-fetching data).

**Practical Example (Handoff):**  
```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner

math_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    instructions="Solve math problems and explain your steps."
)

history_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    instructions="Provide historical context and facts."
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Route questions to the correct specialist.",
    handoffs=[history_agent, handoff(math_agent)]
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "Who was the first president of the United States?")
    print(result.final_output)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

**Orchestrating via Code:**  
Chaining agents together for multi-step tasks (e.g., research → summarization → critique) using Runner.run and `result.to_input_list()` to pass outputs as new inputs.

---

## 7. Context Management  
**Summary:**  
- **Local Context:**  
  - Represents local dependencies and state (e.g., user info, service clients) injected into every tool and hook.
  - Not visible to the LLM; used only within your Python code.
- **Agent/LLM Context:**  
  - Refers to the conversation history or prompt context that the LLM sees.
  - Can be modified via dynamic instructions or input composition.

**Practical Example (Local Context):**  
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, RunContextWrapper

@dataclass
class UserInfo:
    name: str
    uid: int

@function_tool
async def fetch_user_age(wrapper: RunContextWrapper[UserInfo]) -> str:
    return f"User {wrapper.context.name} is 47 years old."

user_info = UserInfo(name="Alice", uid=101)
agent = Agent[UserInfo](name="Assistant", tools=[fetch_user_age])

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "What is my age?", context=user_info)
    print(result.final_output)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## 8. Tracing  
**Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Tracing provides an end-to-end record of agent workflows. It captures LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrail evaluations, and custom events.  
- **Components:**  
  - **Traces and Spans:** Each agent run is wrapped in a trace that includes nested spans for individual operations (e.g., function calls, LLM outputs).
  - **Customization:** You can disable tracing globally or per-run, and even send traces to custom processors (e.g., for integration with external monitoring tools like LangSmith or MLflow).
- **Benefits:** Helps in debugging, performance monitoring, and optimizing complex agent workflows.

**Practical Example (High-Level Trace):**  
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke Generator", instructions="Tell a funny joke.")
    with trace("Joke Workflow"):
        first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print("Joke:", first_result.final_output)
        print("Rating:", second_result.final_output)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

## 9. Agent Visualization  
**Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Visualization provides a graphical representation of your agent workflow—including agents, tools, and handoff relationships—using Graphviz.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Generate a graph to understand or debug the structure of your application.
  - Customize output by saving to a file or viewing in a separate window.
- **Elements:**  
  - **Nodes:** Agents appear as yellow boxes, tools as green ellipses.
  - **Edges:** Solid arrows represent handoffs between agents; dotted arrows represent tool invocations.

**Practical Example:**  
```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool
from agents.extensions.visualization import draw_graph

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish Agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish."
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English Agent",
    instructions="You only speak English."
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Route based on language and use available tools.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
    tools=[get_weather],
)

# To display the graph inline:
draw_graph(triage_agent)

# To view in a separate window or save:
graph = draw_graph(triage_agent)
graph.view()  # Opens in external viewer
graph.render(filename="agent_graph.png")  # Saves as PNG
```

## Conclusion  
Each component of the Agents SDK—from the core agent definition and model selection, through tool integration and memory management, to guardrails and orchestration—plays a critical role in building robust, real-world agentic applications. By combining these primitives, developers can create flexible, safe, and efficient workflows that are both autonomous and controllable through code.

These summaries and examples provide a practical guide to understanding and implementing effective agent workflows using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
