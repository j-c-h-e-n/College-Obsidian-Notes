The Market Opportunity

Vizier enters a market primed for growth. In 2024, revenue from digital newspapers and magazines is forecasted to reach $40.23 billion globally, with a user base projected to hit 1.6 billion by 2029. The global daily newsletters market, valued at $12.54 billion in 2023, is projected to grow to $18.66 billion by 2030, with a conservative CAGR of 6.4%. This shift toward digital platforms is reshaping the media landscape, with the U.S. leading the way, generating $16.43 billion in 2024.

North America and Asia-Pacific are key regions expected to see strong newsletter market growth between 2024 and 2030, offering ample opportunities for innovation. COVID-19, geopolitical shifts, and the social media revolution have dramatically altered global consumption habits.
