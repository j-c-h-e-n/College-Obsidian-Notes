# Operational Semantics
Since we are now able to design a language, we may also want to: 
1. Give meaning to the language.
2. Prove the correctness of a program created in our designed language. <br>
*Semantics* refers to the meaning of a statement, and *operational* refers to how something operates.<br>
## 1. Meaning
The question that surrounds meaning is "how do you explain a phrase to someone unfamiliar with the language?". <br>
There are 3 ways in programming:
- Denotations: describes meaning through mathematical constructs.
	- Providing definitions (mathematical definitions).
- Operational: describing meaning through how something operates.
	- Providing cases of how we would use it.
- Axiomatic: describing meaning through axioms (truths).
	- Providing truthful examples.<br>
When we explain a language (target language) to someone, we often use another language to do so called the Meta-language. For example, explaining OCaml, the target, to someone using English, the meta. <br>
## 2. Correctness
Correctness is in essence, "does the program run how we expect it to run?".
