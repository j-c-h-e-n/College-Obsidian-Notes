# Comparisons
```ocaml
true > false
: true

"hi" > "hello"
: true

"a" > "b"
: false

"c" > "b"
: true

[1;3] > [1;2];;
: true
```
Like any other language, OCaml has comparison operators, but unlike other languages, OCaml comparisons accept any type. So `val (operator) : 'a -> 'a -> bool`. <br>
# Bindings
## Let Expression
`let var = e1 in e2;;` does not bind the name first assigned to var to a value.  <br>
For example,
```ocaml
let var = e1:t1 in e2:t2
: type: t2

let x = true in (if x then 3 else 4)
: type: int
```
Notice how the first "assigned" variables are not bound, so their types are not part of the type definition of the function. <br>
We can also only chain the "let" expression together with "in" if we decide to put "let" in the middle of a function:
```ocaml
let x = 4;; (* acceptable *)
5 + (let x = 4) - 5;; (* not ok *)
let area rad =
	let pi = 3.14 in 3.14 *. rad *. rad;; (* we use the "in" keyword to allow a let expression *)
```
### Modular Expression
These are a OCaml specific definition, and an example of one is simply: <br>
`let x = 8 in x;;` where trying to access "x" again results in an unbound value. <br>
