# Functions and Expressions
### Expressions
Expressions have types:
- The `if` expression:
```
if (guard) then
	true_branch
else
	false_branch
```
Notice how we do not have curly brackets and we use the key words **if**, **then**, **else**.
We can build upon the expressions such as:
`1 + (if true then 3 else 4)`<br>
One key thing to note is that the if statements has a type (expressions have types).
The structure ends up being 
`(if e1: bool then e2:t else e3:t):t`
Where e1 is specifically a boolean, and then e2 and e3 are of the same type, of which the expression will be the same type as e2 and e3 as well.

### Functions
```
let func x = x + 1
let func_name arg arg2 ... = body
```
Functions also have types and the first function has the type of int. Calling the function like a mathematical function such as `func(3)` will yield 4.
