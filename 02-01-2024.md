# Functions and Expressions
### Expressions
Expressions have types:
- The `if` expression:
```
if (guard) then
	true_branch
else
	false_branch
```
Notice how we do not have curly brackets and we use the key words **if**, **then**, **else**.
We can build upon the expressions such as: <br>
`1 + (if true then 3 else 4)`<br>
One key thing to note is that the if statements has a type (expressions have types).
The structure ends up being <br>
`(if e1: bool then e2:t else e3:t):t`<br>
Where e1 is specifically a boolean, and then e2 and e3 are of the same type, of which the expression will be the same type as e2 and e3 as well.

### Functions
```
let func x = x + 1
let func_name arg arg2 ... = body
```
Functions also have types and the first function has the type of int. Calling the function like a mathematical function such as `func(3)` will yield 4. <br>
We can also dictate the type of a function where we state: <br>
`let add1 x = x +. 1.` <br>
`utop: val add1 : float -> float = <fun>`<br>
This causes the function to be of type float, where it takes a float and outputs a float. <br>
`let add1 x = (int_of_float x)` <br>
`utop: val add1 : float -> int = <fun>` <br>
This causes the function to be of type int, where it takes a float and outputs an int. <br>
`let add x y = (int_of_float x) + y` <br>
`val add : float -> int -> int = <fun>` <br>
`add 3. 4`<br>
`utop: int = 7`<br>
This is how you call a function, notice no braces and no commas.<br>
#### Recursive Functions
A factorial implementation: <br>
`let rec fact x = if x = 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1));;` <br>
This is also a function of type int that combines conditionals, function declaration, definition, and recursive call all into one line. <br>
```
let rec fact x = 
	if x = 1 then
		1
	else
		x * (fact (x-1)
```

```
fact 4
:= 4 * (fact (4-1))
4 * (fact 3)
etc...
```

# Lists
This is a built-in datatype within OCaml and it also has a type which is determined by the data it holds: <br>
`[1;2;3;]`is an "int list"<br>
`[true; false;]`is a "bool list" <br>
Most importantly, lists **CANNOT** mix types. It must be homogenous. <br>
`([e1:t;e2:t...]):t`<br>
Since everything in OCaml is immutable, the list cannot be modified after creation. <br>
