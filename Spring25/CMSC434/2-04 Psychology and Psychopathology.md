"Avoiding an instinct to blame the user"
- Discoverability: What actions are possible? - How do you perform those actions?
- Understanding: How is it meant to be used? - What do the settings mean?

System Usability Scale:
- Quick 10-item "likert-style" (1-5 scale) questionnaire that might support "quick and dirty" evaluation of technology and software.
	- Pros: Easy to administer.
	- Cons: Don't know what the issue is if there is dislike.
