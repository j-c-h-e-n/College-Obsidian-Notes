# Higher Order Functions
## Anonymous Functions
The basic definition of a function is that it is something that *takes in a value, and returns an output* <br>
We've been naming functions with a name and then calling functions by their name: <br>
```ocaml
let f x = x + 1;;
f 5;;
: int = 6
```
Behind the scenes, function calls during runtime jumps to where the function was defined, passes values, and then jumps back to where it was branched. <br>
What happens with something such as `int x = 4, x + 5`?<br>
The computer looks for the address of x, then it extracts the value x holds, before performing addition. <br>
In OCaml, we create anonymous functions by using the keyword "fun".
```ocaml
(* example of normal function *)
let f x = x + 1

(* example of anonymous function *)
fun x -> x + 1
```
But now that we don't have a name, we can't call it. We solve this by doing:
```ocaml
let f = fun x -> x + 1
```
Except that this is exactly what happens when we create a normal function `let f x = x + 1`<br>
If we only want to have a single instance run function so that we don't have to give it a name, we can do:
```ocaml
(fun x -> x + 1) 5
```
## Partial Applications of Functions
Here's a problem: 
- Function: 1 input, 1 output
- Issue: 0 input... >1 input... 0 output... >1 input 

##### 0 output
When nothing is returned, a *unit* is returned instead. <br>
For example, the method print_string returns nothing to the computer after printing a statement, so it is of *unit* datatype. <br>
`let x () = print_string "hello";; (* returns : unit -> unit = <fun> *)`<br>
##### 1> output
When we have more than one output, we can have something such as nested functions. <br>
```ocaml
fun x -> (fun y -> x + y);;
(fun x -> (fun y -> x + y) 4) 5;;
: int = 9

(* more examples *)
let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y
let g = f 5
	(* this is the same thing as
		(fun x -> fun y -> x + y) 5 -> (fun y -> 5 + y) *)
```
The process of functions returning functions is called *currying*, allowing nested functions. <br>
# Functions as Variables
We can use functions as variables:
```ocaml
let f1 = fun x -> x + 1;;
let f2 = fun x -> x > 5;;
let f3 = fun x -> x * 10;;
apply f1 5;; : int = 6
apply f2 5;; : bool = false
apply f3 5;; : int = 50
```
We can also make the apply keyword into a function, making the command: <br>
`let apply f x = (f(x))`<br>
More examples:
```ocaml
let addgenerator x = fun y -> x + y;; : int -> int -> int = <fun>
let add3 = addgenerator 3;; : int -> int = <fun>
add3 5;; : int 8
let add5 = addgenerator 5;; : int -> int = <fun>
add5 5;; : int 10
(addgenerator 5) 3;; : int = 8 (* this is the same as add3 5 *)
```

# Additional Functions
## Map
```ocaml
let rec map f lst = match lst with
	| [] -> []
	| x::xs -> (f x)::(map f xs)

: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list

map (fun x -> x + 1) [1;2;3;4]
: int list = [2;3;4;5]

```
Map takes in a function and another input, and applies the function to every input given. Thus as shown above, providing map a function and a list of `[1;2;3;4]` we end up with a list of `[2;3;4;5]` which is the result of adding 1 to every value. <br>
```ocaml
let is_even_list lst = map (fun -> if x mod 2 = 0 then true else false) [1;2;3;4]
: 'a -> bool list = <fun>
```
This will return a bool list with values of either true or false depending if the value is even or odd. <br>
## Fold
```ocaml
let rec concat lst = match lst with
	| [] -> ""
	| h::t -> h^(concat t)

let rec sum lst = match lst with 
	| [] -> 0
	| h::t -> h+(sum t)

let rec product lst = match lst with
	| [] -> 1
	| h::t -> h*(product t)
```
We can see that all of these functions are very similar. The format is as goes:
```
let rec "name" lst = match lst with
	| [] -> "base case"
	| h::t -> h ("function") ("name" t)
```
Applying more abstraction...
```
let rec fold lst "base_case" "function" = match lst with
	| [] -> base_case
	| h::t -> ("function' h (fold t))
```
Notice how "name" changed into fold. This is the very definition of "fold", which allows us to make simple functions even more simple and less repetitive. <br>
```ocaml
fold ["a"; "b"; "c"] "" (fun x y -> x ^ y);;
: string = "abc"

fold [1;2;3;4;5] 0 (fun x y -> x + y);;
: int = 15

fold [1;2;3;4;5] 1 (fun x y -> x * y);;
: int = 120

```
However, **this is not stack friendly**. A variation of fold called `fold_left` is more stack friendly.
```ocaml
let rec fold_left f a l = match l with
	| [] -> a
	| x::xs -> (fold_left f (f a x) xs)
```
`fold_left` uses a better optimization and can accomplish the same things as `fold`(check this information). <br>
