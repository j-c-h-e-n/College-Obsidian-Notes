# Higher Order Functions
## Anonymous Functions
The basic definition of a function is that it is something that *takes in a value, and returns an output* <br>
We've been naming functions with a name and then calling functions by their name: <br>
```ocaml
let f x = x + 1;;
f 5;;
: int = 6
```
Behind the scenes, function calls during runtime jumps to where the function was defined, passes values, and then jumps back to where it was branched. <br>
What happens with something such as `int x = 4, x + 5`?<br>
The computer looks for the address of x, then it extracts the value x holds, before performing addition. <br>
In OCaml, we create anonymous functions by using the keyword "fun".
```ocaml
(* example of normal function *)
let f x = x + 1

(* example of anonymous function *)
fun x -> x + 1
```
But now that we don't have a name, we can't call it. We solve this by doing:
```ocaml
let f = fun x -> x + 1
```
Except that this is exactly what happens when we create a normal function `let f x = x + 1`<br>
If we only want to have a single instance run function so that we don't have to give it a name, we can do:
```ocaml
(fun x -> x + 1) 5
```
