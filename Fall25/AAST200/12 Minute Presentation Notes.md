"Race is not a category of nature; it is an ideology through which unequal distributions of wealth and power are naturalized â€” justified in the language of biology and genealogy."
- Break it down:
	1. Race is a social invention.
	2. Designed to create artificial gaps in wealth and power while pretending that it is natural.
	3. Justified by abusing biology and genealogy to create pseudo-science to support their false claims.

Asian Americans have a hard time becoming naturalized citizens of the US on the basis of being perceived as an alien.
- Ozawa v. US: Ozawa's "Japanese Blood" made him ineligible to become an American no matter how assimilated he was and no matter how white he appeared.
- US v. Thind: Despite showing that he had "white blood" and was of Aryan descent, he was deemed ineligible to become an American through the claim that he would never be socially accepted as white and by extension, an American citizen.
