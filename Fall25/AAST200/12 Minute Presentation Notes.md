- March 1997 National Review magazine cover.
- Slanted + squinted eyes, buck teeth.
- Al Gore wearing a traditional red Chinese dress
- Bill Clinton wearing a rice hat, serving tea, wearing traditional Chinese shoes.
- Hillary wearing the uniform of a Maoist red army soldier while carrying a "Little Red Book" from the days of Mao.

"Race is not a category of nature; it is an ideology through which unequal distributions of wealth and power are naturalized â€” justified in the language of biology and genealogy."
- Break it down:
	1. Race is a social invention.
	2. Designed to create artificial gaps in wealth and power while pretending that it is natural.
	3. Justified by abusing biology and genealogy to create pseudo-science to support their false claims.

Asian Americans have a hard time becoming naturalized citizens of the US on the basis of being perceived as an alien.
- Ozawa v. US: Ozawa's "Japanese Blood" made him ineligible to become an American no matter how assimilated he was and no matter how white he appeared.
- US v. Thind: Despite showing that he had "white blood" and was of Aryan descent, he was deemed ineligible to become an American through the claim that he would never be socially accepted as white and by extension, an American citizen.

## Popular Culture and Race
Arguments and explaining the connection between popular culture and race.
- The roots of popular culture are in the organic culture of the common folk, often in opposition of the court and bourgeois. Thus commonly characterized as politically resistant.
Who/What is American? What gets to dictate this?
- Popular culture is a "significant arena" where which this is defined.
	- Race is an unfortunate byproduct in chasing reasons to create social differences and has become deeply entrenched with popular culture.
The "Oriental" as a racial category has now become intertwined with popular culture.
- Discussions of the Oriental end up relating to race, class, gender, sexuality, family, and nation.

## The Stereotype and the Family (Analysis of Image)
- The first family is always presumptively white in the popular imagination - until Barack Obama came along.
- "Yellowface transforms the first family historically and symbolically white, into the Oriental family: Bill, Hillary and Al have, through the pollution of Asian money become alien, yellow, and Oriental."
- "The fiction of common ancestry (both biological and cultural) has been made central to the construction of both race and nation."
	- Kinship, Motherland, Brotherhood, Mother tongue, Fatherland
	- Common ancestry relates to family, which is where the concept of unity comes to fruition to hold a country and its people together.
	- It gives people organization in the form of a hierarchy.
- The Asian American family has been portrayed as "intact", "disciplined", and "patriarchal" and became the model for economic success during a time of economic decline.
- The Clinton family passed legislature benefiting Asian Americans.
	- "The Clinton administration's East Asia security and trade policy initiatives dispelled doubts whether the United States would stay engaged in the region in the aftermath of the Cold War. Administration policies firmly demonstrated continued U.S. commitment to and engagement in, East Asia.
	  
	  Administration policies focused on strengthening the U.S. alliance with Japan; engaging China with firmness and principle; contributing to improved stability on the Korean Peninsula; elevating the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to the leadership level; normalizing relations with Vietnam; supporting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF) on security cooperation; expanding democratization and human rights efforts; and launching initiatives in environmental protection, narcotics interdiction, public health, and women's rights.
	  
	  That the President's first official trip overseas was to East Asia highlighted his commitment to U.S. engagement in the Asia Pacific region. During President Clinton's two terms in office, he and Secretaries of State visited Asia more than any of their predecessors. Regular attendance by the President, the Secretary and other U.S. officials at meetings of APEC, the ASEAN, and ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum) changed the way the United States related to, and did business in, the Asia-Pacific region.
	  
	  In June 1993, President Clinton announced his New Pacific Community initiative, which placed U.S.-Japan relations at the center and promoted economic cooperation through APEC, democracy and human rights across the region. Similarly, the 1993 bilateral U.S.-Japan Common Agenda coordinated the scientific and financial resources of the world's two largest economies on numerous joint projects dealing with critical transborder problems worldwide like the eradication of infectious disease and environmental protection."

All of these factors have varying degrees of influence in the racist yellowface caricature of the Clinton family.
