Some quotes and facts to potentially use:

- It is not without reason to say that the media's unfair coverage of the LA riots inadvertently fueled the flame for African Americans to target Koreans.
- "Latinos comprised 51 percent of those arrested by Los Angeles police during the riot; blacks, 38 percent; whites, nine percent and Asians, two percent. Conversely, our content analysis shows 48 percent of the Los Angeles rioters shown on television were black; 31 percent were Latino; 12 percent were Asian, and nine percent were white... On the \[national news programs\], blacks comprised 58 percent of the rioters shown; Latinos, 24 percent; whites, 10 percent, and Asians, seven percent." - source 6, Harvard
- "The media didn't cover the failure to address the policing,... It didn't cover the failure to provide the economic infrastructure, and what we ended up with was kindling building and building." - source 5, NBC news
- The media targeted Koreans, showing them as racist and gun bearing when in reality incredibly few shops had owners who could afford guns. Even then, they used them in self-defense and not the offensive that the media showed them as. - source 5, NBC
- The police were incredibly slow to respond to the rioting, often not intervening at all during the start of the rioting. - across all sources
