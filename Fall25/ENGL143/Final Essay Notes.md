- Topic: Aggregate Du Bois graphs/visualizations
- Overall message of my infographic: (something related to Georgia and something related to expenditures and statuses?)
	- Maybe something relating to certain US-wide-trends and the comparison of these to current/near-current day statistics.
	- Maybe the evolution of statistical presentation through the lens of race reporting?
		- Relate to cultural phenomenon 
			- the modern priority of seeing data within a broader context (graphs now talk about x vs y in the bigger scope of z).
			- the past priority of just seeing the raw data as it is without relative context and without comparisons to another.
- Du Bois created these for the 1900 Paris Exposition
	- The Paris Exposition was a world-fair held to present achievements of the past and accelerate into the new century. The audience was likely everyone that would go to the exposition.
- Who am I presenting to?
	- Experts who want a full picture between data collection efforts of the 20th century, how the presentation of data was biased, how easy it is to present an unrepresentative image through the lack of details.
	- MORE DETAIL PLEASE.
- How does my remediation complement, reinforce, revise, enhance, or challenge the original one in the role of achieving its goal?
	- It highlights the differences between 20th century and 21st century data visualization efforts. It challenges the past view

Presenting 1 or 2 in-depth analysis of visualizations from Du Bois vs modern day. Remediation: Instead of Du Bois' revolutionary visualizations from the 1900s that showcase matters of race, I will frame Du Bois' visualizations as WHAT NOT TO DO IN THE MODERN AGE OF VISUALIZATIONS. I will use modern visualizations that roughly capture the message in Du Bois' viz to show the audience (primary audience will be second year university students with an interest in data representations - visualizations - that want to learn how to create better visualizations. I will use Du Bois' work as a counter-example, of what not to do.) that although Du Bois was revolutionary, they are objectively not good visualizations.
- They are:
	- Too ambiguous.
	- Fails to capture wider contexts.
	- Does not draw any comparisons/have a frame of relativity (i.e. raw numbers).
	- Often lacks important labels.
	- Presentation is seemingly biased.
