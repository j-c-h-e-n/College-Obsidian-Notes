## Overview
- Going on a scalar journey, across different magnifications. Looking at how covid has shaped each level and the data visualizations that came with them.

## The Virus Level
- Aesthetic choices contributed to the famous covid-19 virus image to promote a message.
	- Red was used to portray that it was serious.
	- Complementary colors to the red makes for contrast and other attention details.
	- It had to be feel real and be believable, so the actual shape/structure of the virus was not changed.
## The Human Level
- Inter-people covid transmission graphs.
- AR visualization of keeping 6 feet apart from other people.
## The Population Level
- Showing trends and simulations of how covid could transmit throughout a population.
- Shows quarantines and simulations of the "disease transmission curve" to figure out how to "flatten" the curve.
- Showed that social distancing was the most effective, better than partial quarantine.
