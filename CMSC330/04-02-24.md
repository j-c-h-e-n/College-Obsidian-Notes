# Property Testing 
## Type Checking
A type system is a series of rules that dictate:
1. What a type is.
2. What we can do with types.
<br>
From using the type system, we can deduce good programs from bad where good programs are often well typed, while bad programs are ill-typed or not typable.
Ex: 
- `0 + 1` is well typed
- false 0 is ill-typed
- `1 + (if true then 0 else false)` ill-typed
<br>
**The process of applying these rules is called type checking.**<br>
We've been learning that ${Lexer\rightarrow Parser \rightarrow Interpreter}$<br>
However the steps more look like ${Lexer \rightarrow Parser \rightarrow TypeChecker \rightarrow Interpreter}$<br>
# Type Systems
In OCaml we have something like: int -> int -> int. <br>
- Generic typing: polymorphism.
- Subtyping: What can we interchange.
- Dependent typing: For example, List.hd.
- Important note: it is impossible to create a perfect system.
	- No type system can do all 3:
		- Be sound
		- Be complete
		- Always terminate

# Subtyping
If we have a function `f: fun(x -> x): 'a -> 'a` this is polymorphic in the way we can extend classes, `class circle extends shape`.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Let `p(x)` be a provable property about objects x of type T:
- Then, `p(y)` should be true for object y of type S, where S is a subtype of T.
