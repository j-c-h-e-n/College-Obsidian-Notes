## Pandas
- Almost entirely functional.
- The *DataFrame* is the star of the show.
- Huge synergy with other libraries.
### Series
- A one dimensional array of data with an index.
- Almost never access a series by an index.
### DataFrame
- A collection of series organized by columns.
- We do not access rows via index.
- We do access columns via their names.
- Literally a spreadsheet.

## SQL
- *Structured Query Language*
- Is how we ask our database questions.
- NOT a programming language.
- Query Example:
```sql
	SELECT * FROM customers WHERE City = Berlin
```
