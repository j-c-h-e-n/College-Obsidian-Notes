- AKA Alpha Value
- Can we say something worked given a specific p-value?
- Ex:
	- If we get a p-value of .2, can we say it worked?
- The significance level is a term used in scientific research to describe when to reject the null hypothesis. Often times it is .05 or .01.
	- This gives us a quick way of describing whether or not it is likely an effect exists.
- YOUR SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL SHOULD BE BASED ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ACTUAL IMPORTANCE IT HAS.
	- A .05 significance level is absurd in certain situations, such as curing cancer. But it is acceptable for something such as a cold treatment.
