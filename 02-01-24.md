# Functions and Expressions
OCaml assigns types to our values through inferring by the operators and context we put our variables through.
## Expressions
Expressions have types:
- The `if` expression:
```ocaml
if (guard) then
	true_branch
else
	false_branch
```
Notice how we do not have curly brackets and we use the key words **if**, **then**, **else**.
We can build upon the expressions such as: <br>
`1 + (if true then 3 else 4)`<br>
One key thing to note is that the if statements has a type (expressions have types).
The structure ends up being <br>
`(if e1: bool then e2:t else e3:t):t`<br>
Where e1 is specifically a boolean, and then e2 and e3 are of the same type, of which the expression will be the same type as e2 and e3 as well.

## Functions
```ocaml
let func x = x + 1
let func_name arg arg2 ... = body
```
Functions also have types and the first function has the type of int. Calling the function like a mathematical function such as `func(3)` will yield 4. <br>
We can also dictate the type of a function where we state: <br>
`let add1 x = x +. 1.` <br>
`utop: val add1 : float -> float = <fun>`<br>
This causes the function to be of type float, where it takes a float and outputs a float. <br>
`let add1 x = (int_of_float x)` <br>
`utop: val add1 : float -> int = <fun>` <br>
This causes the function to be of type int, where it takes a float and outputs an int. <br>
`let add x y = (int_of_float x) + y` <br>
`val add : float -> int -> int = <fun>` <br>
`add 3. 4`<br>
`utop: int = 7`<br>
This is how you call a function, notice no braces and no commas.<br>
### Recursive Functions
A factorial implementation: <br>
`let rec fact x = if x = 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1));;` <br>
This is also a function of type int that combines conditionals, function declaration, definition, and recursive call all into one line. <br>
```ocaml
let rec fact x = 
	if x = 1 then
		1
	else
		x * (fact (x-1)
```

```ocaml
fact 4
:= 4 * (fact (4-1))
4 * (fact 3)
etc...
```

# Datatypes
## Lists
This is a built-in datatype within OCaml and it also has a type which is determined by the data it holds: <br>
`[1;2;3;]`is an "int list"<br>
`[true; false;]`is a "bool list" <br>
Most importantly, lists **CANNOT** mix types. It must be homogenous. <br>
`([e1:t;e2:t...]):t`<br>
Since everything in OCaml is immutable, the list cannot be modified after creation. <br>
What about an empty list? <br>
`let is_empty lst = lst = [];;`<br>
`utop: val is_empty : 'a list -> bool = <fun>` <br>
Its interactions are interesting: <br>
``` ocaml
Within UTop:
is_empty [true;false;];;
console: bool = false
is_empty [true; false;];;
console: bool = false
is_empty [];;
console: bool = true
```

The definition of a list:
- A list is either empty or a node that points to a list.
We can view lists as values "conned" together, so `[1;2;3;4] = 1::2::3::4::[]`<br>
## Tuples
- Tuples can be heterogenous (containing a mix of different datatypes within it). 
- The size is fixed.
- Tuples are "," delimited.
- Tuples are held by parenthesis, not brackets (brackets will be lists).<br>
Example of a tuple: `(1, 2)`<br>
We can perform pattern matching with Tuples:
```
match x with
	| (a, b) -> a + b;;
```
## Unit
Units are a datatype used for circumstances when there is nothing. <br>
For example:
`();; (* returns : unit = () *)` <br>
`let x = print_string "hello";; (* returns : unit = () *)` <br>
Happens when a function returns nothing, or *void*.
# Operators
## Comparisons
Comparison operators work as normal, except for their types.<br>
`3 > 3;;`<br>
`Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type int` <br>
Let's try:<br>
`let cmp x y = x > y;;`<br>
`val cmp : 'a -> 'a -> bool = <fun>`<br>
'a is a type for generics in OCaml. <br>
`let cmp x y = x > false;;`<br>
`val cmp: bool -> 'a -> bool = <fun>`<br>
`let cmp x y = 3;;`<br>
`val cmp : 'a -> 'b -> int = <fun>` <br>
## Cons
We also have a new operator called "cons" `::`<br>
This here operator appends values to the front of lists, creating an entirely new list. <br>
`lst = []` <br>
`0::1::2::[]` <br>
Creates a new list with the values `[0;1;2]`<br>

# Primitives
Ints are represented as normally expected, but floats are all denoted by a period right after the number AND operator. <br>
`1. +. 2.`<br>
`float = 3.`<br>
The same period happens for every operator to make it a "float operator".<br>
# Pattern Matching
To put it simply, it is a "simple switch statement". <br>
```ocaml
(match value:t1 with 
	value1:pattern -> ret_val1:t2 
	| value2:pattern -> ret_val2:t2
	| value3:pattern -> ret_val3:t2):t2
```
All of the statements have to share the same value, and the function will be of the same value. All of the values that the original value matches (compares to) *are of type pattern*. <br>
Example:
```ocaml
let x = 4
let match_x x =
	match x with
		1 -> "a"
		| 2 -> "b"
		| 3 -> "c"
		| _ -> "d" (* _ is a wildcard *)
```
An interesting pattern matching implementation is with lists: <br>
```ocaml
let match_lst lst = match lst with
	[] -> 0
	| [x] -> 1
	| head::tail -> 2

match_lst [] (* returns 0 *)
match_lst [true; false] (* returns 2 *)
match_lst [true] (* returns 1 *)
```
## Recursive Pattern Matching with Lists
```ocaml
let rec add_list lst = match lst with 
	[] -> 0
	| x::xs -> x + (add_list xs)

add_list [1;2;3;4] (* returns 10 *)

(* this is the same as asking:
match [1;2;3;4] with
	[] -> 0
	| 1::[2;3;4] -> 1 + (add_lst [2;3;4])
This recurses into
match [2;3;4] with
	[] -> 0
	| 2::[3;4] -> 2 + (add_lst [3;4])
*)
This keeps recursing and returning until eventually in the original
recursive call...
	| 1::[2;3;4] -> 1 + (2 + (3 + (4)))
```
## Recursive Pattern Matching with Tuples
Tuples are sets that can contain any type all at the same time, unlike lists. <br>
`(1,2,3)  (* int * int * int = (1,2,3) *)`<br>
`(1, true, 3)  (* int * bool * int = (1, true, 3) *)`<br>
With pattern matching:
```ocaml
let match_tup x = match x with
	(a,b,c) -> (b,c,a)

(* returns a function with type 'a * 'b * 'c -> 'b * 'c * 'a = <fun>)
match_tup (1, 2, 3)  (* returns (2, 3, 1) *)
```
If we have tuples inside of lists, we can extrapolate the data by doing:
```ocaml
match lst with
	| (a,b)::xs -> a + b;;
```
If we have lists inside of tuples, we can extract information by:
```ocaml
match (a,b) with
	| (x::xs, y::ys) -> x = y;;
```
This basically takes the head of the lists, x and y, and adds the heads together. We can further recurse by later calling the function name with xs and ys as parameters.
