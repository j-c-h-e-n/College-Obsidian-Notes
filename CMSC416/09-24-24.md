# Performance Modeling, Analysis, and Tools

## Weak VS Strong Scaling
- Strong scaling: Fixed total problem size as we run on more processes.
	- Sorting n numbers on 1 process, 2 processes, 4 processes, ...
	- Problem size per process decreases with increase in number of processes.
- Weak scaling: Fixed problem size per process but increasing total problem size as we run on more processes.
	- Sorting n numbers on 1 process.
	- 2n numbers on 2 processes.
	- 4n numbers on 4 processes.
## Amdahl's Law
- Speedup is limited by the serial portion of the code.
	- Often referred to as the serial "bottleneck".
- Lets say only a fraction $f$ of the code can be parallelized on $p$ processes.
$$ Speedup = \frac{1}{(1-f)+f/p}$$
## Performance Analysis
- Parallel performance of a program might not be what the developer expects.
- How do we find performance bottlenecks?
- Performance analysis is the process of studying the performance of a code.
- Identify why performance might be slow:
	- Serial performance.
	- Serial bottlenecks when running in parallel.
	- Communication overheads.
