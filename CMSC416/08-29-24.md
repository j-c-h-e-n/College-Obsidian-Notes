## Terminologies and definitions of parallel computing
- Core: a single execution unit that has a private L1 cache and can execute instructions independently.
- Processor: several cores on a single Integrated Circuit (IC) or a chip called a multi-core processor. 
- Socket: physical connector into which an IC/chip or processor is inserted.
- Node: a packaging of sockets - motherboard or printed circuit board (PCB) that has multiple sockets.

## Job Scheduling
- HPC systems use job or batch scheduling.
- Each user submits their parallel programs for execution to a "job" scheduler.
- The scheduler decides:
	- What job to schedule next.
	- What resources to allocate to the jobs.
