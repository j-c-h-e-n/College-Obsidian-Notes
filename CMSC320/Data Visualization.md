## Types of Graphs
- Distributions are great but the x-axis usually becomes unreadable.
	- Great for continuous or ordinal data.
	- Histograms.
		- The main graph to create
- Composition and Comparison:
	- Bar charts
- Correlational graphs are good for comparisons between two variables.
	- Scatter plots.
	- Very easy to see relations and also notice outliers.
	- But also extremely easy to manipulate the visual aspects.
- Change over time
	- Line graphs.
	- Checking trends over time.

- Use tables to make one or two cells really stand out.
- Heatmaps are great for communicating 3 variables.
	- Good for categorical or binned information.
	- Magnitude
- Bubble plots also good for magnitude.
- Pie charts are ok. People are usually bad at telling circular areas.
- Stacked area chart is good for change over time when comparing multiple variables and the total of all variables is also important.
	- Still hard to tell the individual variables.
- Box plots are great to compare and visualize distributions with their mins, averages/medians, and maximums.
- Maps for actual geographical data.
- Network Maps shows a lot of compressed information and their relations to each other. 
	- But usually really entangled.


## Visual Perception
- Visual attention theory. 
	- Using colors and orientations to grab the attention of viewers.
		- Don't overuse these.
- Preattentive features.
	- Our abilities can extract color, size, or tilt without any effort.
- Colors:
	- Make them make sense.

## Design Principles
- Cut out the fluff, maximize information, minimize extraneous ink.
- Start broad and zoom in. (multiple graphs if necessary)
-
