## Types of being wrong
1. Your theory makes incorrect predictions.
2. Your theory doesn't make any predictions at all.
### Incorrect Predictions
- You come up with some rules that govern the world, but later, the world does not behave in accordance with those rules.
	- Exceptions arise from this,.
	- Don't keep applying rules upon rules.
	- Most of the time, simpler is better.
### Non-Theories
- If your theory makes *no predictions at all*, it's bad.

## Experiments
- We will either:
	1. Run post-hoc experiments on data we've already collected.
	2. Set up experiments to run in the real world.
### Polling Caveats
- Dishonest responses.
- Cannot survey those who do not want to be polled.
- If a variable is linked to an extrinsic caveat, those will never be detected.
### General Things to be Aware of
- Each component of the experiment have to be isolated from each other (blinding).
- Placebo effects.
- What if you are actually wrong?
- Random sampling.
- Don't keep adding onto your experiment when you are wrong.
### Good Hearts Law
- Trying to come up a metric to quantify something
	- If the subjects become aware of this metric, they will strive to optimize it in any way possible.
### Pulling it Together
- When we design an experiment, we divide people into a **treatment** and a **control**
	- **Blinding** is applied to ensure the tester don't know what we are testing to avoid innate biases (placebos or hiding the experiment).
- **Confounding** variables are variables that influence both dependent and independent variables.
	- Ex: Smokers tend to drink coffee and get diagnosed with lung cancer, but drinking coffee doesn't imply lung cancer.
### Types of Experiments
- Your data must be representative of the population you want to study.
- Ways to get data:
	- Observational studies
		- Cross sectional - looks at data at a single point in time.
		- Retrospective (case control) - looks at students of events in the past.
		- Prospective (longitudinal or cohort) - researchers follow and observe groups closely.
			- These tend to have high dropout rates.
		- Surveys
			- Wording of questions can introduce bias.
			- Ordering of questions (implanting ideas).
			- Convenience samples/self-selected samples.
			- Desire of respondents to please.
			- Confidentiality concerns may influence responses.
			- Non-response bias.
